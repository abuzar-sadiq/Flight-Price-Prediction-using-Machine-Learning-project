# Flight-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-project
Problem Statement: Predict the ticket price for the flight using the Linear Regression Algorithm
Tasks
Hypothesis-based EDA:

Does the price vary with Airlines for the same source_city to destination_city?

How is the price affected when tickets are bought just 1 or 2 days before departure?

Does the ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?

Check the distribution of the Price variable and remove outliers to create a new dataset.

Build a Linear regression Model with all the features (m1), select only the top 5 features using the model coefficient, and rebuild the regression model (m2) again using Statsmodels. Observe if there are any differences between the two models in Adjusted-R2 and R2. 

Build a Linear Regression model using Scikit learn and Statsmodels; compare the results analyze the impact of airlines, time of purchase, and departure/arrival time on ticket prices.
